            <h2>About Me:</h2>

            <p>My name is Weston DeVore. I originally got into programming in 2013 through Minecraft’s “command blocks.” I was in 5th grade. I would spend hours creating what are essentially loops and html classes and changing different ways of how the game operated. As I got more into it and started spending hours every night working on it, I realized that I rather enjoyed coding more broadly. In 8th grade, I started learning C++. Because of trauma I experienced around that same time period, it ended up fading out of my life for a few years. Life became more complicated, and I didn't have the time or energy to spend all night teaching myself how to code. At the end of high school, I decided to try to get back into it for a career. I figured “I know kind of what to expect. I'm good with computers generally. I know I CAN learn it. Let’s go for it,” and I did. I joined the Eleven Fifty Academy, and here I am now.</p>
